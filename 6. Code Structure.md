# Code Management:

## 1. Code Distribution:
1.  Create a **main** folder at the root of your project.
2.  Inside the **main** folder, create the following files:

	1.  **main.js:** Move the main code from your existing script to this file.
	2.  **config.js:** Move the code related to reading and processing the configuration file to this file.
	3.  **windows.js:** Move the code related to window creation and handling to this file.

4.  Update the file paths for the **bundledConfigRoute, bundledIconRoute, localConfigRoute, and localIconRoute** variables based on the new structure.
5.  Properly write the standard comments on the functions and the code.
6.  Create a new variables file **"var.js"** (all the paths)

	1.  Read the variables.
	2.  Set them globally.
	3.  Update the code accordingly.

		{

		"bundledConfigRoute" : "./config/config.json",

		"localConfigRoute" : "../../resources/config/config.json",

		"bundledIconRoute" : "./icons/win/logo.png",

		"localIconRoute" : "../../resources/icons/win/logo.png"

		}

## 2. Prettier (Formatting):

To format all files with Prettier follow the below steps:

1. Command to install the prettier package: 

	    npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
	    
2. Command to check, if any file is not formatted correctly. To do so, add this to the package.json (in the **script** tag) 

	    "check-beautify": "prettier --check ."	
	        
3.  Command to update the code (beautify), if any file is not formatted correctly it will update them. To do so, Add this to the package.json in the **script** tag:

	    "beautify": "prettier --write ."

## 3. Linter (Code-quality):

 1. To check the code quality, These are the style guidelines for coding
    in Electron.
    
 2. You can run  `npm run lint`  to show any style issues detected by 
    `cpplint`  and  `**eslint**`.
    
 3. Run the command below, this opens a **npm init @eslint/config** and lets you choose
    between the different config options.

		    npm init @eslint/config
		   

		    √ How would you like to use ESLint? · problems
		    √ What type of modules does your project use? · commonjs
		    √ Which framework does your project use? · none
		    √ Does your project use TypeScript? · No / Yes
		    √ Where does your code run? · browser
		    √ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript
		    Local ESLint installation not found.
		    The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:
		    
		    eslint@latest
		    √ Would you like to install them now? · No / Yes

 4. After this command, it will generate a new file for lint configuration, it will look similar to the below file and also a bit different according to the options you chose above.

	    module.exports = {
	      env: {
		        browser: true,
		        commonjs: true,
		        es2021: true
		    },
			extends: ['eslint:recommended'],
	        overrides: [],
		    parserOptions: {
		        ecmaVersion: 'latest'
		    },
	      rules: {}
	    }


 5. This makes sure that only new code changes are checked and not the entire code base.  
`npx eslint "./**/*.js" --cache --cache-strategy content --fix`  
Add this to your  `scripts`  in **package.json** to avoid typing this long line every time.

	    "scripts": {  
	      "lint": "npx eslint \"./**/*.js\" --cache --cache-strategy content --fix"  
	    }
	Run this command on the terminal: `npm run lint.` 

***Note:*** When you run you will see that there are a lot of errors, in which there are **few keywords or vocab which linter doesn't understand.**

	C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\src\main\config.js
	  45:36  error  'process' is not defined  no-undef
	  80:27  error  'process' is not defined  no-undef
	
	C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\index.js
	  25:7  error  'BrowserWindow' is not defined  no-undef
	
	C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\src\main\index.js
	  13:7  error  'process' is not defined  no-undef

	  39:5  error  'before' is not defined    no-undef
	  50:5  error  'it' is not defined        no-undef
	  62:5  error  'after' is not defined     no-undef

	C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\test\windows.spec.js
	   6:1  error  'describe' is not defined    no-undef
	   7:3  error  'beforeEach' is not defined  no-undef
	  19:3  error  'describe' is not defined    no-undef
	  20:5  error  'it' is not defined          no-undef
	  54:3  error  'describe' is not defined    no-undef
	  55:5  error  'it' is not defined          no-undef

	✖ 20 problems (20 errors, 0 warnings)

**Solution:** 
Add a few parameters in the **env section** of the **.eslintrc.js** file
1. For **"process"**,  include **node: true**.
2. For **"it" & "describe"**,  include **jest: true**.
3. For **"before" & "after"**,  include **mocha: true**.
4. For **"BrowserWindow"**,  include **BrowserWindow** at this line **const {app, ipcMain} =  require('electron');**.
## 4. Google Code Style:

To follow the same and the standard code style pattern, I used **eslint-config-google**.
 
 1. To check the code quality, These are the Google code style guidelines for coding
    in Electron.
    
  2. To install the suitable package to enforce Google code style, you need to run this command:
    `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-google`
3. Now, add the google code styling constrain in the **.eslintrc.js** file.
`extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'google']`
4. Simply run the previous command of eslint:
    `npm run lint`
5. You will see a lot of errors like this:

		C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\src\main\config.js
		  26:31  error  '__dirname' is not defined  no-undef
		  31:17  error  'process' is not defined    no-undef
		  32:17  error  '__dirname' is not defined  no-undef
		  56:34  error  '__dirname' is not defined  no-undef
		  60:17  error  'process' is not defined    no-undef
		  61:17  error  '__dirname' is not defined  no-undef

		C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\OneDrive\Unige\Courses\Thesis\Basic apps\Electron.js\src\main\index.js
		  11:7  error  'process' is not defined        no-undef
		  18:7  error  'BrowserWindow' is not defined  no-undef
		  19:5  error  'createWindow' is not defined   no-undef
	
6. In this case, we need to ignore the error "no-undef" property, for this you need to write a rule in **.eslintrc.js** like below:

	    rules: {
		    'no-undef':  'off',
	    }, 
	  
## 5. Unit Testing:

#### Comparison of best npm package for unit testing:
There are several popular npm packages available for unit testing in JavaScript, each with its own strengths and features. The choice of the best package depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here are three commonly used npm packages for unit testing:

1.  **Mocha**: Mocha is a flexible and widely adopted testing framework. It provides a simple and expressive syntax for defining tests and supports various testing styles (e.g., BDD, TDD).
    
2.  **Jest**: Jest is a comprehensive testing framework developed by Facebook. It aims to provide a zero-configuration experience, making it easy to set up and start testing right away.
    
3.  **Jasmine**: Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework that offers an easy-to-understand syntax for writing tests. It provides a rich set of features for writing assertions, organizing tests into suites, and handling asynchronous code. 

#### Steps to writing unit tests:
 1. To check the written code by unit test, These are the style guidelines for running the unit test code in Electron.
    
  2. You can run  `npm install chai mocha sinon --save-dev` to install all required packages.
 2. Create a folder **"test"** in the main directory if already not created.
 3. Create files **"windows-spec.js"** and **"config-spec.js"**.
 4. Write the unit test for each function. I covered below functions:
	 1. config.js:
		 **1. readVariables**
	      **2. readConfigurations**
	 2. windows.js
		**3. getWindowLayout**
		 **4. getDisplaySequence**
   6.   Add this to your  `scripts`  in **package.json** to run the unit test suites.

	    "scripts": {  
						"test": "mocha"
	    }
4. Run this command to execute all the test suites:
		`npm run test`
5. Output: 
		
		  config.js
		    readVariables
		      ✔ should read variables from file and set globaly
		    readConfigurations
		      ✔ should read configurations from file and set globally

		  windows.js
		    getWindowLayout
		      ✔ should calculate the window layout
		    getDisplaySequence
		      ✔ should get the display sequence ID for a given monitor number


		  4 passing (36ms)

## 6. Code Coverage Tool:
One popular and widely-used package in the npm ecosystem for code coverage analysis is Istanbul, specifically its Istanbul.js library. Istanbul.js provides a command-line interface and a comprehensive set of tools for tracking and reporting code coverage across unit tests.

To get started with Istanbul.js, you can follow these steps:

1.  Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2.  Create a new project or navigate to your existing project's directory.
3.  Initialize a new npm package by running `npm init` in the project directory and following the prompts.
4.  Install the Istanbul package as a development dependency by running `npm install --save-dev nyc`.
5.  Write your unit tests using a testing framework like Mocha, Jasmine, or Jest (or any other framework of your choice). Make sure your tests are runnable using a test runner.
6.  Run your tests using the Istanbul command-line interface. For example, if you're using Mocha, you can execute your tests with code coverage by running `nyc mocha`.
7.   Add this to your  `scripts`  in **package.json** to check unit test suites code coverage.

	    "scripts": {  
						"test": "nyc mocha"
	    }

8. Output looks like:
		
		  config.js
		    readVariables
		      ✔ should read variables from file and set globaly
		    readConfigurations
		      ✔ should read configurations from file and set globally

		  windows.js
		    getWindowLayout
		      ✔ should calculate the window layout
		    getDisplaySequence
		      ✔ should get the display sequence ID for a given monitor number


		  4 passing (28ms)

## Prettier vs. Linters

### How does it compare to ESLint/TSLint/stylelint, etc.?

Linters have two categories of rules:

**Formatting rules**: eg:  [max-len](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-len),  [no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs),  [keyword-spacing](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/keyword-spacing),  [comma-style](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-style)…

Prettier alleviates the need for this whole category of rules! Prettier is going to reprint the entire program from scratch in a consistent way, so it’s not possible for the programmer to make a mistake there anymore :)

**Code-quality rules**: eg  [no-unused-vars](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars),  [no-extra-bind](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-extra-bind),  [no-implicit-globals](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-implicit-globals),  [prefer-promise-reject-errors](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-promise-reject-errors)…

Prettier does nothing to help with those kind of rules. They are also the most important ones provided by linters as they are likely to catch real bugs with your code!

In other words, use  **Prettier for formatting**  and  **linters for catching bugs!**
