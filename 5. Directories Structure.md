  # Structure Code & Directories!

There are many ways to structure your directories and code. Let's start with directories first. I made a few changes from the default project, which are mentioned below:

1.  No use of package-lock.json:

    - **Packge.json** has more than just dependencies, it also establishes a project's attributes, descriptions, and license information.
    
2.  Package-lock.json is just used to lock dependencies.

3.  Rename the out folder:

	- **dist** (for compiled or bundled files)

5.  Add a docs folder: which will contain
6.  Replace the folder name from src/assets to src/main.
7.  Also add another folder in src **"src/renderer"** (in our case it's not required as we don't need any renderer pages).
8.  Move the **config directory** to the **root directory**.
9.  Add new folder **"resources"** in the main directory. And move the **"icons"** folder in it.

	- Create a **"window"** folder to store resources specific to windows (like icons)

11.  Of course I changed:

		-  Path of **index.js** in **package.json**.
		- Path of the **config file** in **index.js**.

13.  There is no need for a folder name **"dist/resources/assets/config/config.json"**.

		- I remove this path while reading the file from a bundled app (**.exe**)

15.  Copy the complete **"Resources"** folder to bundled app.  
    

		    "from": "./resources/",
		    
		    "to": ".",
		    
		    "filter": [
		    
		    "**/*"
		    
		    ]

12.  Set the config and icons in all the 3 ways:

- I use the following folders structure which allows me to run the app anyway.
	- For Local run
	- For UnPacked
	- For Installed folder

13.  Create a separate **"test"** folder for your unit tests, organized into subdirectories mirroring the code structure.

### Questions:

**Q:** How should I **bundle the resources** (config and icons)? What is the best way?

- I use the following folders structure which allows me to run the app anyway.

	- from **project folder**:  `node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd src\main\index.js`

	- from **unpacked source**:  `dist\win-unpacked\app.exe check-for-update`

	- from **installed folder**:  `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\app\app.exe`

**Q:**  Why does packaging always **copy the files in the resource folder**?

**Ans:** The extraResources field is similar to files but it copies the files relative to the project directory (and not the app directory) to the resources directory of the application bundle (such as the Contents/Resouces directory of the .app file in macOS).
