## Create Basic app in at least two frameworks (Electron + NW.JS), which must include the following:

1.  Read the config file.<br>
2.  Extend the app a/c to config.

	   -  Extension can be 1D or 2D

3.  Open the browser on full screen.<br>
4.  Make executable (packaging).<br>
5.   *Organized the Electron Project:*
	   - *To structure the code.*
	   - *To structure the directories and files.*
	   - *To Beautify or Format the code (Best Formatter).*
	   - *To write the unit test.* 
  
6.  Executable should read the config file.

	   - The file can be in an argument.
	   - last option: Copy all the resources including the config file in the bundled folder.
7.  *Read the Config file which contains the endpoint only ([http://www.testingapi.com/getconfig](http://www.testingapi.com/getconfig))*

8. *Bundle the app for Linux also.*
9.  *Read the Config file in the Linux distribution.*
10.  Pull Request for config + packaging.
---
10. Bundle the app for Linux Distribution **Rpm** and test.
10. 2D Display Extension testing.
12.  *Auto-Update service.* (optional)
11. Show Splash Screen (to show version no).

> After working on both apps **till point 4**, we decided to go with
> **Electron.JS** for further requirements.
