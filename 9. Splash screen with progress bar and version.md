This browser window is a splash screen, that allows the users the see version of the application and check the updates. 

### How it works:

1. The application (API) **checks the update** using any package.
2. When it **finds any update** available . 
	- It should send a message **"update available"** to Splash Screen.
3. When Splash Screen receives a message about the available update.
	- It should **show a screen (popup)**, which asks for the user's consent about downloading the newly available update.
4. If the user allows to **download now**, it should send a message **"update now"** to API.
5. When API receives this message, it will **start downloading**.
6. While downloading, API should continuously send the messages to the Splash screen with the **updated progress** of updates downloading.
7. Splash screen should receive the progress, and present them in a **progress bar**.
8. Once, downloading is done. The splash should be **closed after a few seconds**.




## Any NPM Package?
To create the splash screens there are some popular npm packages like [trodi/electron-splashscreen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trodi/electron-splashscreen). f the application is taking a bit to load,  `electron-splashscreen`  will appear so the user knows the application is loading, but can't interact with a partially loaded application.

`electron-splashscreen`  is simple to incorporate, while allowing you the freedom to customize with any look, feel, and functionality.

If you read the documentation of `trodi/electron-splashscreen`, you will see that it's very similar to `BrowserWindows`. In our case, I prefer the `BrowserWindows` to create a splash screen, as it allows you more control over the npm package.

## Browser Window
We decided to create a separate JavaScript class `splash.js` which creates the browser windows as **Splash**.   We also create a directory `splash` in the resources with one **HTML** file and **CSS** file. 

This screen will show the version of the application, with the following components:

1. **Logo.**
2. **Animation** (GIF).
3. **Version.**
4. **Message** (Update available, Not available, Downloading, Closing)
5. **Progress Bar.**
6. **User Consent Popup** (for downloading new updates).

### Why I didn't pick the npm package?
1. **Flexibility and Customization:** You have full control over the splash screen's appearance by designing a bespoke splash screen. It can be carefully customized to adhere to the branding and design standards of your application.

2. Building your own splash screen with the help of the BrowserWindow enables smooth UI integration across the rest of your program. **Without any external dependencies** or potential conflicts, switching from the splash screen to the main application window is simple.

3. **Lightweight Approach:** Using a package to implement the splash screen feature could add more dependencies to your project. Using the BrowserWindow to create a unique splash screen is a good choice if you want to keep your program lightweight and free of pointless dependencies.

4. **Learning and Exercising Development abilities:** By working directly with Electron's APIs and learning how to manage and adjust windows in your application, creating a custom splash screen offers the chance to improve your development abilities.

5. **Specific Requirements:** You might need unique functionality or behavior in your splash screen that is not offered by existing packages, depending on the needs of your application. When using BrowserWindow to create a custom solution, you can include the particular functionality you require.

## How backend communicate with Splash Screen (UI)?
It uses the [IPC](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc) **(Inter-Process Communication)**. Many typical actions, like using a native API from your UI or triggering changes in your API to UI, can only be carried out through IPC.

### Channels IPC
All the processes communicate by sending messages through "channels" that developers create, with the help of the `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` modules. These channels can have any name you like, and they are also bidirectional, allowing you to utilize the same channel name for both modules.

### 1. Splash screen to API:
In order to send a message from the splash screen to API, we can use the `ipcRenderer.send` API **in Splash Screen** to send a message that will then be received by ipcMain.on  **in API**. 

The ideal use-case, in this communication type is when user  

#### In splash screen (HTML):

	<button  class="update-button"  onclick="updateNow()">
	
	<script>
		const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron');
		function  updateNow() {
			ipcRenderer.send('updateNow');
		}
	</script>
#### In API:

	const { ipcMain } =  require('electron');
	ipcMain.once('updateNow', () => {
		//Start downloading....
	});
	
### 2. API to Splash screen:
The other way around is, to **send a message from API to the splash screen**. 

There are **two use cases** where we send a message from API to the splash screen. 
1. When there is any available update.
2. When API needs to update the downloading progress in UI. 

#### In API:

	const  topic  =  isProgress  ?  'progress'  :  'message';
	splashScreen.webContents.send(topic, text);
	
#### In splash screen (HTML):

	ipcRenderer.on('message', function (event, text) {
		// Implementation for displaying a message.
	}
	
	ipcRenderer.on('progress', function (event, text) {
		// Implementation for displaying a progress bar.
	}
