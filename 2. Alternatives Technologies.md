  # Alternative Technologies!

  Considering the requirements, we have in the requirements section. There are a few suggestions to go with the following technologies specific to our requirements. I choose them on the following parameters:
  - Cross-Platform
  - Full-Screen Mode
  - Extension of screen
  - Multi-Window
  - Auto-Updatable
  - Size of the App
  - Future Capacity to extend the features
  - Community
  - Primary Use



  ## Electron Js:

  **Electron** is an open-source framework for building **cross-platform** desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has extensive **support for creating multiple windows**, including the ability to **position them** according to the configured screen layout. Electron also has built-in **support for auto-updates**, which makes it a great choice for this requirement.

  ## NW.js

  **NW.js** is another open-source framework for building **cross-platform** desktop applications using web technologies. **Like Electron**, it has extensive **support for creating multiple windows** and can position them according to the configured screen layout. It also **supports auto-updates**, making it a good choice for this requirement.

  ## JavaFX

  **JavaFX** is a **cross-platform** framework for building desktop applications using the Java programming language. It has **support for creating multiple windows** and positioning them on different screens. JavaFX can be used to build both Windows and Linux applications with the same codebase. **Auto-update functionality** can be implemented **using external libraries** such as JReleaser.

  ## React Native for Desktop

  React Native for Desktop is a framework for building **cross-platform** desktop applications using web technologies and the React Native framework. It has **support for creating multiple windows** and positioning them on different screens. React Native for Desktop can be used to build both Windows and Linux applications with the same codebase. **Auto-update** functionality can be implemented **using external libraries** such as electron-updater.

  ## Can we pick C#?

  Yes, **C#** is a powerful programming language that is commonly **used for developing desktop applications**. It has a rich set of features for creating multiple windows and positioning them on different screens.

  In particular, the .NET framework provides a range of libraries and tools for developing desktop applications in C#. For example, the Windows Forms and WPF frameworks provide support for creating multiple windows and positioning them on different screens.

  Additionally, C# can be used to build **cross-platform desktop** applications using the .NET Core framework. This allows you to build applications that run on both Windows and Linux platforms with the same codebase.

  **Auto-update** functionality can be implemented **using external libraries** such as AutoUpdater.NET or ClickOnce, which provide easy ways to update desktop applications in C#.


  # Why Not?

  There are some particular reasons to drop a few of the stacks specially Flutter and PhantomJs. 

  ## Why Not Flutter?

  **Flutter** is primarily a mobile app development framework and **does not have built-in support for creating multiple windows** or positioning them on different screens. While it is technically possible to create a desktop app using Flutter, it may not be the best choice for this specific requirement.

  There are **workarounds to achieve multiple windows** in Flutter, but they **require additional effort** and are not as straightforward as using other frameworks like Electron or NW.js. Additionally, implementing **auto-update functionality in Flutter may require custom solutions** or third-party packages.

  ## Why Not  PhantomJS?  

  **PhantomJS** is a headless web browser that can be used to automate web page interactions, but it is not a suitable choice for the above requirement.

  PhantomJS is primarily **designed for headless web scraping, automated testing, and other tasks that do not require a graphical user interface**. It does not provide a graphical user interface for opening multiple windows on different screens, **nor does it have built-in support for auto-updates**.

  In contrast, frameworks like **Electron, NW.js, and JavaFX** provide robust support for creating **cross-platform** desktop applications with **multiple windows** and **auto-updates**. Therefore, it is not recommended to use PhantomJS for this specific requirement.

  ## Comparison Table:

  |Stack|Cross-Platform|Full Screen Mode|Extension of screen|Multi-Window|Auto-Updatable|App Size|Expandability| Community| Primary Use
  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
  Electron.JS| YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|Big|YES|Big|Desktop/Web
  NW.JS| YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|Huge|More for Browser|Small|Desktop/Web
  ~~JavaFX~~| YES|YES|YES|YES|External library|Small|YES|Huge|Desktop
  ~~C#~~| YES|YES|YES|YES|External library|Small|YES|Light|Desktop
  ~~Flutter~~| YES|Not Built-in|Not Built-in|Not Built-in|Not Built-in|Normal|Not Much|Growing|Desktop
