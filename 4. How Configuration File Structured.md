The given **config.json** file contains configuration information for an Electron app that opens different browser applications based on the defined settings. Here is an overview of the configuration:

1.  **monitors_sequence**: This section defines the sequence of monitors to be used. It used to map every monitor with its id, so it will take care in case of  the system has a different order of monitors. Each monitor has two properties:
    
    -   **monitor_no**: Represents the monitor number, as the user wants to order.
    -   **id**: Specifies an ID associated with the monitor in OS.
2.  **monitors_layout**: This section defines the layout settings for the monitors. Each layout configuration has the following properties:
    
    -   **page**: Specifies the URL or webpage to be opened in the browser application.
    -   **monitor_no**: Indicates the monitor number to which the layout applies.
    -   **extended_height_to**: Specifies the extended height ratio of the layout.
    -   **extended_width_to**: Specifies the extended width ratio of the layout.
    -   **dev_mode**: *(future)* Specifies the developer mode of the browser.

Based on this configuration, the Electron app will open browser applications with the specified URLs on the defined monitors, following the sequence specified in **monitors_sequence**. The layout settings in **monitors_layout** determine the positioning and sizing of the browser windows on the respective monitors.
