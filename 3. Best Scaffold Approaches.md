  # Best Scaffold Approaches!

  Considering the requirements, and the selected technology we selected **ElectronJs**. Of course, there is always a contradiction about the best approaches to follow. I read a few of the articles and concluded it in this document. 
  
  There are a few things to consider while seeking the best way to do it. 
  - To **structure the code**.
  - To **structure the directories** and files.
  - To **Beautify or Format the code** (Best Formatter).
  - To **Static Code Analysis** (Linter)
  - To **write the unit test** (only few).

1. ## Structure Code & Directories:
-   Keep the main process code in the src/main folder and the renderer process code in the src/renderer folder.
-   Place the configuration file (config.json) for layouts in the src/main/config folder.
-   Group related code files into appropriate subdirectories, such as windows for window-related code in the main process and components for UI components in the renderer process.
-   Create a separate tests folder for your unit tests, organized into subdirectories mirroring the code structure.

2. ## Writing Code:

-   Follow the best practices for Electron.js and the JavaScript framework you choose for the renderer process.
-   Implement separate modules or classes in the main process to handle configuration reading, window management, and other tasks.
-   Utilize a component-based architecture like React or Vue.js in the renderer process to manage screens, apps, and UI components.
-   Implement logic to read the configuration file (config.json) in the main process and use the retrieved data to allocate screens and open different browsers on multiple screens.

3. ## Test Cases:

-   Write unit tests for critical functions, modules, or components, focusing on areas like configuration reading, window management, and screen allocation.
-   Organize your tests in the tests folder, creating subdirectories like main and renderer to mirror the code structure.
-   Ensure to cover the essential functionality, including reading the configuration file and allocating screens.  
      
    

4. ## Beautify and Indentation: 
-   Use a code formatted like Prettier to automatically format your code and maintain consistent styling.
-   Configure your code editor or IDE to integrate Prettier and format your code on save.
-   Set the desired indentation style (spaces or tabs) and ensure consistent indentation across files.

5. ## Code Analyzer: (Linter)
- It will help you improve your code. The concept of linter isn’t exclusive to JavaScript. Still, I’d say that the majority of people trying to learn about linters are interested in the ones that target JavaScript (or, more generally, dynamically-typed languages.)
