# Electron JS App Packaging!
To bundle your Electron JS application for Linux and Windows, we have various tools and utilities available. One of the popular tools is **Electron Builder**, which simplifies the packaging process and creates distributable packages for different platforms.

 **Electron Builder** is a complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows, and Linux with “auto update” support out of the box.


 -   Numerous target formats support:
    -   All platforms:  `7z`,  `zip`,  `tar.xz`,  `tar.lz`,  `tar.gz`,  `tar.bz2`,  `dir`  (unpacked directory).
    -   [macOS](https://www.electron.build/configuration/mac#MacConfiguration-target):  `dmg`,  `pkg`,  `mas`,  `mas-dev`.
    -   [Linux](https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux#LinuxConfiguration-target):  [AppImage](http://appimage.org/),  [snap](http://snapcraft.io/), Debian package (`deb`),  `rpm`,  `freebsd`,  `pacman`,  `p5p`,  `apk`.
    -   [Windows](https://www.electron.build/configuration/win#WindowsConfiguration-target):  `nsis`  (Installer),  `nsis-web`  (Web installer),  `portable`  (portable app without installation), AppX (Windows Store), Squirrel.Windows.
   
   In our case, we need to bundle the app for two major distributions which are **Windows:  nsis & Linux: deb**. Also in the future, we will need the **"Auto Update"** feature in the bundle tool.
 
## Implementation:

 - To install **electron-builder** use this command:

	    npm install electron-builder --save-dev
	    
 -  Specify the standard fields in the application  `package.json`  —  **name, description,  version, and author**. 

 -  Specify the  [build](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#configuration)  configuration in the  `package.json`  as follows:
    
		"build": {
		    "productName": "Shaheen",
		    "appId": "com.example.hitachi-electron-app",
		    "directories": {
		      "output": "dist"
		    },
		    "extraResources": [
		      {
		        "from": "./resources/",
		        "to": ".",
		        "filter": [
		          "**/*"
		        ]
		      }
		    ],
		    "win": {
		      "target": "nsis",
		      "icon": "resources/icons/win/icon.ico"
		    },
		    "linux": {
		      "target": "deb",
		      "icon": "resources/icons/linux/256x256.png"
		    }
		  }
    
    For our project, I used a  few important options which are below:
     1. **directories:** it has **output** attribute which contains the path of the directory to store bundled package.
     2. **extraResources:** A relative to the project directory, when specified, copy the file or directory with matching names directly into the app’s resources directory  `resources` for Linux and Windows).
     3. **win:** described in the next section.
     4. **linux:**  described in the after `window` section.

	5.  Add  [icons](https://www.electron.build/icons).
# Windows:
Currently, I am using Windows for the development of this application. So, it's not an issue to test the installer for Windows. I choose **nsis** which is recommended. 

1. For packaging the application in Windows include this in the `build`

	-   `target`  =  `nsis` 
		- The target package type: list of  `nsis`,  `nsis-web`  (Web installer),  `portable`,  `appx`,  `msi`,  `squirrel`,  `7z`,  `zip`,  `tar.xz`,  `tar.lz`,  `tar.gz`,  `tar.bz2`,  `dir`. AppX package can be built only on Windows 10.

	-   `icon`  =  `build/icon.ico`  String | “undefined” - The path to the application icon.

2. Add `"build": "electron-builder"` in the script tag.
3. Run the command on the command line `npm run build`
4. You will see the the **`installer`** and the **`.exe`** in the directory **`dist`**


# Linux:
As I mentioned before I am using Windows. In order to build and test the Linux package I need to setup the Linux environment. 

 **Virtualized Environment: VMWare Workstation 17 pro**
**Linux Distribution: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS** (That's why I choose **deb**)

I follow the official documentation of [`electron-builder`](https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux)
1. For packaging the application in Windows include this in the `build`

	 - `target`  =  `deb`  
	   - Target package type: list of  `AppImage`,  `flatpak`,  `snap`,  `deb`,  `rpm`,  `freebsd`,  `pacman`,  `p5p`,  `apk`,  `7z`,  `zip`, 
	   `tar.xz`,  `tar.lz`,  `tar.gz`,  `tar.bz2`,  `dir`.

	- electron-builder  [docker image](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build#docker)  can be used to build Linux targets on any platform.

2. Add `"build-linux": "electron-builder --linux"` in the script tag.
3. Run the command on the command line `npm run build-linux`

### Problem:
At this stage, I face an issue, which is acknowledged by a lot of threads online:
The host `https://service.electron.build` is down  which is  a major issue by `electron-builder`

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that such an issue will be fixed anytime soon, as we can see from the amount of (mostly open) GitHub issues that have been opened by users that are trying to deal with such problems in the past months:
Threads:
1. [Connection to remote builder refused, while building linux package #3569](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/3569)
2.   [service.electron.build is unavailable](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-build-service/issues/5)
3.  [Error: Cannot get, wait error=Get https://service.electron.build/find-build-agent](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-build-service/issues/9)
4. [service.electron.build is unavailable - Urgently please suggest an alternate](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-build-service/issues/8)

7. [Connection to remote builder refused, while building linux package](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/3569)

### Solution:
So, I used the following workaround using Docker image `electronuserland/builder` that made me able to build a Linux redistributable `.deb` package for my Electron App from Windows 10 in less than 5 minutes:

-   Install Docker ([link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
-   Download the [electronuserland/builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/electronuserland/builder/) Docker image with the following console command:

	    docker pull electronuserland/builder

-   From the Electron project's root folder (such as C:\MyApp), type the following command-line command to run the container and map the Electron project's root folder to the /project virtual path:

		docker run -rm -ti -v C:\MyApp\:/project -w /project electronuserland/builder

-   From inside the container, type the following commands to upgrade the Electron project's Yarn packages, globally install the electron-builder package and build the Linux redistributable package:

		cd /project

		yarn upgrade

-   At this stage, I got another error, as the node version is mismatched so I follow the below steps to install the desired version of **node (16.13.0)** in the container using the URL.

- Once you are inside the container's shell, you can use nvm (Node Version Manager) to update the Node.js version:

	-   Install nvm by running the following command: (This will download and install nvm.)

			curl -o- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh) | bash

-   Load nvm by running the following command: (This will load nvm into the current shell session)

		. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

-   Install Node.js version 16.13.0 by running:

		nvm install 16.13.0

-   Switch to the installed Node.js version by running:

		nvm use 16.13.0

-   Verify that the Node.js version has been updated by running:

		node -v

-   Finally, I can install yarn by this command:

		Yarn install

-   Try again yarn upgrade

		yarn global add electron-builder
- Build the package for linux (deb)

	    electron-builder -l or npm run build-linux

If everything went smoothly, you should be able to locate your **`Shaheen_1.0.0_amd64.deb`** file inside the Electron project's /dist/ folder.

## Update: Linux package for Rocky Linux: (rpm)

As we are using **Agile** and in this model we adopt changes over time. We decide to add a new Linux package **"Rocky Linux 9"** to build a package for it.

**Virtualized Environment:** `VMWare Workstation 17 pro`
**Linux Distribution:** [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/download/)
**Architecture:** `x86_64`
**ISOS:** `DVD`
**Version Details:**
`NAME="Rocky Linux"`
`VERSION="8.8 (Green Obsidian)"`
`ID="rocky"`
`ID_LIKE="rhel centos fedora"`
`VERSION_ID="8.8"`
`PLATFORM_ID="platform:el8"`
`PRETTY_NAME="Rocky Linux 8.8 (Green Obsidian)"`

### Steps to follow:

1.  For packaging the application in Rocky Linux I include this in the  `build` and `target` sections.
    
    -   `target`  =  `rpm` and `AppImage`
    
    Final build section:
    
	    "linux": {
	    	"target": ["deb","AppImage", "rpm"],
	    	"icon": "resources/icons/linux/256x256.png"
	    }
        
2.  Add  `"build-linux": "electron-builder --linux"`  in the script tag.
3. Other than this, we need to follow the same steps using **Docker Image**  [electronuserland/builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/electronuserland/builder/).
    
4.  Run the command on the command line  `npm run build-linux` from the
5. Copy the `.rpm` bundled app to `Rocky-Linux` OS. 
6. Run the file as `Application-Installer`.
7. When you run the app `Shaheen` it will create a folder in `./config` with `config.json` file. 
8. It depends on the user by whom you run the app, you will find **`config.json`** in the following path:
	- **Normal User:** `/home/abdul/.config/Shaheen/config.json`
	- **Root:** `/root/.config/Shaheen/config.json`
