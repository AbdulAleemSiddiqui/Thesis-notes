# Configuration File!


The given **config.json** file contains configuration information for an Electron app that opens different browser applications based on the defined settings. Here is an overview of the configuration:

1.  **monitors_sequence**: This section defines the sequence of monitors to be used. It used to map every monitor with its id, so it will take care in case of  the system has a different order of monitors. Each monitor has two properties:
    
    -   **monitor_no**: Represents the monitor number, as the user wants to order.
    -   **id**: Specifies an ID associated with the monitor in OS.
2.  **monitors_layout**: This section defines the layout settings for the monitors. Each layout configuration has the following properties:
    
    -   **page**: Specifies the URL or webpage to be opened in the browser application.
    -   **monitor_no**: Indicates the monitor number to which the layout applies.
    -   **extended_height_to**: Specifies the extended height ratio of the layout.
    -   **extended_width_to**: Specifies the extended width ratio of the layout.
    -   **dev_mode**: *(future)* Specifies the developer mode of the browser.

Based on this configuration, the Electron app will open browser applications with the specified URLs on the defined monitors, following the sequence specified in **monitors_sequence**. The layout settings in **monitors_layout** determine the positioning and sizing of the browser windows on the respective monitors.

# Approach #1
## How to read it?
There are multiple ways to read the **Configuration File**: (it works in the same priority)

 1. Pass the local path of configuration file **as  Argument**.
	
	     Dev:
	     npm run start -- --config=C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\Temp\config.json
	     Win Production:
	     shaheen.exe  -- --config=C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\Temp\config.json
	     Linux Production:
	     shaheen  -- --config=C:\Users\Aleem\Desktop\Temp\config.json

2. Finally, read the **endpoint from the file endpoint.json** from the same place. And create an **HTTP request** to access that endpoint in order to get the config json (same as config.json). **/resources/config/endpoint.json**
 3. Read the file from **/resources/config/config.json**.
	 1. When the app is installed: `'C:\Users\Aleem\AppData\Local\Programs\Shaheen\resources\config\config.json'`
	 2. When the app is running locally:
	  `'dist\win-unpacked\resources\config\config.json'`
	  
### Conclusion:  
I used **"process.resourcesPath"** + resources/config/config.json. 
In Linux, it returns: **`/opt/Shaheen`** + resources/config/config.json
In Windows, it returns: **`C:\Users\Aleem\AppData\Local\Programs\Shaheen`** + resources/config/config.json 

In both cases, it works!
## Priority:
1. The first priority is to give **argument**, the user needs to pass json configuration absolute path as argument.
2.   if it's not provided try to read the config from the relative path of  **/resources/config/endpoint.json**
 to get the config. 
3.  Read the config from the relative path of  **/resources/config/config.json**

# Approach #2
## How to read it?
There are multiple ways to read the **Configuration File**: (as per discussion only two ways)

 1. Pass the local path of configuration file **as  Argument** as the first approach.
	 - Here, I used **npm package** **`commander`** to read the command line argument.

2. Another way, read the **endpoint from the file config.json** and create an **HTTP request** to access that endpoint in order to get the JSON configuration.
3. ### Electron-Store:
	- Here, I used **npm package** **`electron-store`** to store and read the configuration (endpoint) .
	- It uses **[XDG Base Directory](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html?_sm_au_=iVVMSnVQNJWsJWMPQ4JkNKtjQC8HC)** to store file, in my case it use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
	- **Advantage:** So, I don't need to write the code to manage reading config files it's already done by the package.
	- 	**Dis-advantage:** I have to store (which creates the config.json file) configuration if the config.json not already exist.
	- Code: (Store and get)
	
		    store.store  = {
		    				endpoint:  sampleEndPoint,
		    		};
		    store.get('endpoint');
	- This package uses the following location for storing config.json:
		- Linux:  **`/home/ubuntu/.config/Shaheen/config.json`**
		- Windows:   **`C:\Users\Aleem\AppData\Roaming\Shaheen\config.json`**

### Conclusion:
It's pretty much an easier solution than the first one.
	  
## Priority:
1. The first priority is to give **argument**, the user needs to pass json configuration absolute path as argument.
2.   if it's not provided try to read the config using the `electron-store` package to get the **endpoint**. 


## Endpoint:
### 1. Free Endpoint Option:
There are several websites and platforms that offer free API endpoints to serve JSON files. Here are a few options you can consider:

1.  **GitHub Gist:** You can create a GitHub Gist containing your `config.json` file and access it via a URL. Gists can be public or private, and they provide a raw URL that serves the file as plain text or JSON.
    
2.  **MyJSON:** MyJSON is a simple, lightweight service that allows you to store JSON data and retrieve it using a unique URL. You can create a JSON object and access it via a URL like `https://api.myjson.com/bins/:id`, where `:id` is a unique identifier for your JSON data.
    
3.  **JSONbin.io:** JSONbin.io provides a free API endpoint for storing and retrieving JSON data. You can create a bin and access it via a URL like `https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/:binId`, where `:binId` is a unique identifier for your JSON data.

I go with the **last one (JSONbin.io)** https://jsonbin.io/ and perform the following steps: 
1. Create an account.
5. Create a bin, with **public visibility**.
6. Paste the configuration JSON into the body.
7. Copy the URL It generated to access the config as JSON:
https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/647bae909d312622a369f7e9

### 2. HTTP Request:
I used **Axios** module to hit the HTTP request to access the endpoint. To install this package, run this command: 

    npm install axios --save-dev 
#### Problem:
1. The problem is it provides the async function **'GET'** and it returns a **promise { < pending > }**. So, I need to change my code as it's all sync it now because creating a window is dependent on reading the configuration.
2. Sometimes it required a secured connection for HTTPS.
		
		axioserror: connect ecanceled at tcpconnectwrap.afterconnect [as oncomplete]
#### Solution:
1. We have two options, first to use **await/async** and second to use **.then()**.
In this updated code, the `readConfigurations` function is declared as `sync`, and returns the promise.  The caller function `setUpConfig`  is also wrapped in a `.then` block to handle the resolved value from `readConfigurations`, and calls a function to `createWindow` and a `.catch` block to handle any errors that occur during the process.
2. I used npm package **`https`** to solve bypass the security certificate. 

		const  agent  =  new  https.Agent({
			rejectUnauthorized:  false, // Bypass certificate verification
		});
		await  axios.get(endpoint, { httpsAgent:  agent });
